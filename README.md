# FTP-Server-Directory-Cloning

This Java project is used to automatically copy an entire directory, including all files and sub-folders inside,
onto a local machine. It also checks to see if the files on the FTP server already exist on the local machine.
In its current implementation it also runs an organization script to automaticallylook for and move specific
files into predefined folders on the local machine
